# API_Mini_Project
For this project, we will focus on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE), which is available for free. We'll try and analyze the stock prices of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery: https://www.zeiss.com/meditec/int/home.html. The company is listed under the stock ticker AFX_X. Source of data : http://www.quandl.com
